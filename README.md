Introduction to scientific python.

The material mostly comes from the

* [PeP et al. Toolbox Workshop](https://github.com/pep-dortmund/toolbox-workshop)
* [A workshop for Astronomers and Particle Physicists at IFAE and ICE](https://github.com/Python4AstronomersAndParticlePhysicists/PythonWorkshop-ICE)
* [The Second Asterics-Obelics School 2019](https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2019)

And was put together and presented by [@kbruegge](https://github.com/kbruegge) and me.
